# Missing Values in Clinical Research: Multiple Imputation

This repository contains slides and materials for the Multiple Imputation part of NIHES course
[EP16: Missing Values in Clinical Research](https://www.nihes.com/course/ep16_missing_values_in_clinical_research/).

This repo has a [website](https://nerler.github.io/EP16_Multiple_Imputation)
where you can find slides and practicals.

Practicals are available as html documents on this webpage and as interactive
[**learnr**](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials here:

* [01 - Getting to Know Incomplete Data](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_IncompleteData)
* [02 - Multiple Imputation using MICE](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_MImice)
* [03 - Checks after Multiple Imputation](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_MIcheck)
* [04 - Analysis of Multiply Imputed Data](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_AnalysisMI)
* [05 - Imputation with Non-linear Effects](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_MInonlin)
* [06 - Imputation of Longitudinal Data](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_MIlong)
* [07 - Imputation of Survival Data](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/EP16_MIsurv)

The practicals require [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and
[JAGS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/) (necessary for the parts of the practical that use the **JointAI** package) need to be installed.

To download JAGS, go to [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/).

The packages used are given at the beginning of each of the practicals.
