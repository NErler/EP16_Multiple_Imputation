\section*{Data}
The \textbf{MIdat13} data comprise data of 792 children and their mothers on
vitamin D exposure of the mother during pregnancy and child bone health,
measured by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry}{DXA scan}, at 6 years
of age. Maternal serum samples were taken in the third trimester of pregnancy.

\bigskip

The dataset contains the following variables:
\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}\toprule
variable & explanation\\\midrule
\texttt{ID} & subject identifier\\
\texttt{gender} & child's gender\\
\texttt{birth} & date of birth\\
\texttt{weight} & child's total weight in kg at DXA scan\\
\texttt{sports} & does the child play do sports regularily?\\
\texttt{BMC} & bone mineral content of the child in grams, determined by DXA scan\\
\texttt{sun\_birth} & average sun light duration in the month before birth in hours/day\\
\texttt{season} & season of blood sampling\\
\texttt{vitD} & mother's serum vitamin D concentrations in 10 nmol/L\\
\texttt{sun} & average sun light duration in hours/day in the month before blood sampling\\
\texttt{ethn} & child's ethnicity\\
\texttt{length} & child's length in cm at time of DXA scan\\
\texttt{parity} & number of pregnancies of more than 20 weeks the mother had
         (nulliparity: this was the first pregnancy,
          multiparity: mother had previous pregnancies)\\
\texttt{birthwgt} & birthweight (standard deviation score)\\
\texttt{leanfrac} & proportion of lean mass (lean mass/total mass; lean mass = total mass - fat mass)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section*{Analysis model of interest}
The analysis model of interest is a linear regression with outcome \texttt{BMC}
and covariates \texttt{vitD}, \texttt{ethn}, \texttt{gender}, \texttt{leanfrac},
\texttt{sports}, \texttt{sun}, \texttt{season}, \texttt{length} and \texttt{weight}.

\bigskip

We assume that \texttt{vitD} has a non-linear (quadratic) effect.
